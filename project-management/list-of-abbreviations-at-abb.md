# List of abbreviations at ABB

## A

**AGB: Autonoom GemeenteBedrijf / Autonomous Municipal Company** is an independent agency of the founding city or municipality and therefore has its own legal identity/ personality. An AGB is always a 100% subsidiary of the founding municipality. An AGB itself can participate in other legal entities in which other (public or private partners) also participate. An AGB is governed by a board of directors. A management committee is responsible for the day-to-day management. The board of directors is composed by the municipal council and consists of a majority of members of the municipal council. Since the composition of the municipal council changes after the six-yearly municipal elections, the board of directors is also reconstituted.

**APB: Autonoom ProvincieBedrijf / Autonomous provincial company (APB**) is a form of provincial external independence. It is set up by the province, has its own legal personality with a public-law status and carries out specific tasks of provincial importance. All tasks of provincial importance are eligible to be taken care of by the APB.​​​​​

## B

**Embeddable** is a 'stripped' version of the application GN/ Linked Minutes that helps local authorities create, annotate and publish agendas, decisions and minutes according to the linked open data principle. This embeddable version is aimed at software suppliers of local governments. The goal of this tool is that they can easily integrate it into the software they have supplied to their customers (local authorities). In this way they do not have to invest time in developing and maintaining core components. The benefit for us as supervising agency is that the quality of the annotated data in the decisions made with this embeddable is up to our standards guaranteeing the reusability of the data.

**GN: Gelinkt Notuleren / Linked Minutes** is an application that helps local authorities to create, annotate and publish agendas, decisions and minutes according to the linked open data principle.

* a front office application for local governments based on the Gelinkt Minutes application of the Agency for Home Affairs (ABB). This allows users to create a new supplementary or temporary regulation.&#x20;
* a management module (central and open register of traffic signs and measures) maintained by the Department of Mobility and Public Works and the Agency for Roads and Traffic. This management module will eventually be used as a source for other mobility applications, for example as a sign library for the Traffic signs.Vlaanderen application.

**LBLOD: Lokale Besluiten als Linked Open Data /** **Local Decisions as Linked Open Data** (LBLOD) is a program. It includes all ABB projects on linked data and local decision making.

Anyone can work with the information in the local acts thanks to LBLOD.

**RDFA: Resource Description Framework in Attributes** is a [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C) Recommendation that adds a set of [attribute-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\_attribute) extensions to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) and various XML-based document types for embedding rich [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) within Web documents. The [Resource Description Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource\_Description\_Framework) (RDF) data-model mapping enables its use for embedding RDF [subject-predicate-object expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource\_Description\_Framework#Overview) within XHTML documents. It also enables the extraction of RDF model triples by compliant [user agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_agent). Ultimately, this recommendation is followed by organizations that want to make their data/ content machine readable.

**RVM: Register van Maatregelen/ Register of measures** is a central digital register for all kinds of measures.

## S

**SPARQL short for “SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language”,** enables users to query information from databases or any data source that can be mapped to [RDF](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-rdf/).

The [SPARQL standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) is designed and endorsed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/2007/12/sparql-pressrelease) and helps users and developers focus on what they would like to know instead of how a database is organized.
