# User Interviews & Testing

## Remote One-On-One User Testing

Since 2020 we have been user testing online. We have found a pretty flexible way to perform that testing. Make sure you adjust the tools according to your needs!

### Screen sharing

When testing on a demo environment: make sure people can share their screen, and have a back-up available that allows you to to share your screen and perform the tasks they want to complete. Make sure you don't steer or influence especially in this case.
