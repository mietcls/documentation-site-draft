Since the composition of the municipal council changes after the six-yearly municipal elections, the board of directors is also reconstituted.

The [Resource Description Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource\_Description\_Framework) (RDF) data-model mapping enables its use for embedding RDF [subject-predicate-object expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource\_Description\_Framework#Overview) within XHTML documents.
