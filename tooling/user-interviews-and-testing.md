# User Interviews & Testing

## Remote One-On-One User Testing

Since 2020 we have been user testing online. We have found a pretty flexible way to perform that testing. Make sure you adjust the tools according to your needs!

### Prepare

#### Your Testing Scene

* 
#### Screen sharing

When testing on a **demo environment**: make sure people can share their screen. Have a back-up available that allows you to to share your screen and perform the tasks they want to complete, just in case it doesn't work out. Make sure you don't steer or influence especially in this case.

### Template
