## How does it work in Gelinkt Notuleren?

Our manual gives a clear view on how GN works \[Dutch].

{% embed url="https://abb-vlaanderen.gitbook.io/gelinkt-notuleren-handleiding/#2-2-agendapunten" %}

### Roles

It is important that each department and all secretarial staff have the role Writer here. This is set on the [Gebruikersbeheer (User Management â€“ ACM-IDM)](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/ict/ict-diensten/gebruikersbeheer), usually by the IT service of the local government.

* `Readers` can view all agenda items.
* `Writers` can view and edit all agenda items.

### **Location**

In Gelinkt Notuleren, files can be prepared in the **Agendapunten (Agenda Items)** tab. It is also possible to create a session directly and add agenda items there - but this is less flexible.

### Status

From the moment an agenda item is agendized and linked to a session, the agenda item will have its `geagendeerd (planned)` status added to it, and you won't be able to add it to any other session.

Agenda items that were adjourned can be copied so they do not have to be rebuilt.
