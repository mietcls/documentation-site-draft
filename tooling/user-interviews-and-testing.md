# User Interviews & Testing

## Remote One-On-One User Testing

Since 2020 we have been conducting remote, online, user tests and interviews. We have found a pretty flexible way to perform that testing. Below you can find a suggestion of how to conduct those user interviews and tests, but make sure you adjust the tools according to your needs!

### Template

### Prepare

#### Define the scope and target group of your session

* Define your **questions**
  * Which assumptions do you know you have, and which ones do you want to test?
  * What answers are you looking for?
  * What do you know you don't know yet?
* Define your target **group**
  * What do you want to test now, and with which target groups?
  * Get an overview of who you need to talk to to get the relevant information for your project – and what steps you can undertake if you cannot find those people right away.

#### Setting up the meeting

* Internal attendees
  * Appoint an **interviewer**, and someone that takes **notes**.
  * If it is a very specific area, you can consider having someone on board \(like a jurist\) to answer specific questions.
  * More than 2 people can be overwhelming to the test subject, so find out what's the best for the outcome.
    * Consider turning off camera's for people that are not taking the interview, but do involve everyone in the introduction and when saying goodbye.
* Interviewees
  * Usually the product manager sets up the meetings via personal contacts, or partnerships that are relevant to the product or via the client \(VVSG – Vereniging van Vlaamse Steden en Gemeenten, Inter, Klankbordgroep Gent\).
  * Make sure you block out enough placeholder time ahead with the appointed team members; so the product manager can align agenda's with the interviewees.

#### Setting up the Scene

* Interview
  * Make people feel at home!
* Demo environment:
  * Make sure you have a separate, stabile test-environment – where anyone can safely add test-data. Warn the developers not to deploy when you are testing!
  * Make sure people can **share their screen** if needed.
    * Have a back-up scenario available that allows you to to share your screen and perform the tasks they want to complete, just in case it doesn't work out. _Make sure you don't steer or influence especially in this case._
