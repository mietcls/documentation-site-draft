# User Interviews & Testing

## Remote One-On-One User Testing

Since 2020 we have been user testing online. We have found a pretty flexible way to perform that testing. Make sure you adjust the tools according to your needs!

### Prepare

#### Define the scope and target group of your session

* What do you want to test now, and with which target groups?
  * Which people will you see later?
* Which assumptions do you know you have, and which ones do you want to test?
* What answers are you looking for?
* What do you know you don't know yet?
* Get an overview of who you need to talk to to get the relevant information for your project – and what steps you can undertake if you cannot find those people right away.

#### Setting up the meeting

* Usually the product manager sets up the meetings via personal contacts, or partnerships that are relevant to the product or via the client \(VVSG – Vereniging van Vlaamse Steden en Gemeenten, Inter, Klankbordgroep Gent\).
* Appoint an interviewer, and someone that takes notes. If it is a very specific area, you can consider having someone on board \(like a jurist\) to answer specific questions. More than 2 people can be overwhelming to the test subject, so find out what's the best for the outcome.
  * Consider turning off camera's for people that are not taking the interview, but do involve everyone in the introduction and when saying goodbye.
* Make sure you block out enough placeholder time ahead with the appointed team members

#### Setting up the Scene

* Interview
  * Make people feel at home!
* Demo environment:

#### Screen sharing

When testing on a **demo environment**: make sure people can share their screen. Have a back-up available that allows you to to share your screen and perform the tasks they want to complete, just in case it doesn't work out. Make sure you don't steer or influence especially in this case.
