# Gelinkt Notuleren, Embeddable en Plug-ins

## Gelinkt Notuleren \(Linked Notetaking\)

**Gelinkt Notuleren** is a web application that helps with the creation and publication of agendas, minutes and decisions for Local Authorities.

The aim of **Gelinkt Notuleren** is not to compete directly with existing notetaking software. The purpose of the application is to show that taking minutes that are enriched with linked open data is possible, and to help local governments without a notetaking package.

**The Embeddable** is part of Gelinkt Notuleren. It is a smart word processor that ensures that specific information from meeting minutes is enriched with data, in a structured way, so that we can extract and reuse that information afterwards.

### Building Blocks

#### Embeddable

**The embeddable** is part of Gelinkt Notuleren. It is a smart text editor that can ensure that specific information from minutes is enriched with data, in a structured way, so that we can extract and reuse that information afterwards.

External suppliers of notetaking software that help local governments with the creation of minutes, can also reuse this embeddable in their software package to extract the data. They are not obligated to use the embeddable, as long as they publish the information according to the standard.

#### Embeddable \(Say Editor\): a smart text editor:

## Reuse of information

Gelinkt Notuleren collects knowledge from decisions that local governments make. This knowledge is then made available for reuse.
