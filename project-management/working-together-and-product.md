# Tools to work together

## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is used as the central communication tool for online communication. All classic agile scrum 'ceremonies' are held using Microsoft Teams (e.g. sprint planning. stand-up, Backlog Refinement, Sprint demo's) as well as the Groeispurt Preparation activities such as Impact- and Story Mapping, Spurt Planning and Spurt Retrospectives.

Furthermore, a number of products use Teams Channels to communicate efficiently on certain relevant topics related to builing, testing, releasing and operating the application(s).

## Sharepoint

Sharepoint is used to properly and securely capture administrative matters of the operation and documents that contain personal information. For example, the attendance calendar and contracts are maintained in this way.

## Miro

We us Miro for various purposes. Product teams engage in Impact Mappings and Story Mappings at various times. During the Central Planning Day we prepare the product planning on Spurt level using a Miro board for every product. During the IPI Miro is also used to carry out Spurt retrospectives where needed.

Some product teams make an even greater use of Miro also preparing product roadmaps and product releases in Miro.&#x20;

## Figma

The prototyping tool Figma is used for [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_interface\_design) and [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_experience\_design) design. It enables the product teams to collaborate in real time on user interfaces: it helps us to design relevant screens for users and it helps us to describe as well as possible how the screens should work to the scrum (dev) team that will build the pages. Next up it helps the test team to get the relevant info on what to test without having to read long documents describing the user interface and user experience.

## Gitbook

The prototype tool Figma is used for designing user interfaces and user experiences. It enables the product teams to collaborate on user interfaces in real time: it helps them to design relevant screens for users and it helps describing how the screens should work. Furthermore it helps the testing team to get the relevant information about what to test without having to read long documents describing the user interface and user experience.



## Feature Passports

A Feature Passport contains all the information to describe a specific functionality of a product. In this way we ensure that everyone understands what we are going to build and what its status is.
