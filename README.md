## **A Semantic Ecosystem**

### **The Value We Deliver For Our Society**

More than 300 Local Governments in Flanders write decisions that contain valuable information – every day. We want to make sure that by using linked open data, they can publish their information and \(legal\) documents directly, and make direct data exchange possible. We make sure we have reusable resources, so that information can flow to other governments & services,  citizens, organisations and companies.

ABB provides support for quality & efficiency, to strengthen those local governments.

### The Solutions We Build

We build services and products to create that value. The linked data streams are made possible in 3 ways:

1. We co-created a Linked Open Data Standard, together with the local governments: a standard way of sharing data between the involved parties.
2. We validate vendors that provide software that supports note taking for local governments; and make sure they exchange and publish their data in a correct manner.
3. We created "Linked Minutes" \(Gelink Notuleren\): basic, free decision-making software for local governments without a software vendor – to support linked data.

This information is captured in the "Box Office for Local Governments" \(Loket voor Lokale besturen\) – a platform for data sharing and communication between local governments and the agency for home affairs.

We make this public data available for other governments & services and private re-users.

The Agency of home affairs deliver support via their helpdesk, give trainings and develop solutions to support local governments.
