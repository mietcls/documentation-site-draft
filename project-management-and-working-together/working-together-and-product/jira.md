# Jira

## Introduction

Briefly explained, a Jira project is a collection of various issue types \(a backlog\) that represent product development work for the agile product team to pick up during future product increments \(called sprints\).

Which issues \(tickets\) are planned in which increment depends on the product roadmap and the strategy behind it. At various time intervals during the calendar year, the agile product teams determine together the priorities for the near future using techniques such as impact mapping and story mapping.

Issues are being recorded in tickets. Tickets are created and kept in a product backlog. Once they are picked up by the scrum team they follow a particular flow, iterating from one status to another. Jira helps us to visualize the status these tickets are in and to track progress on the tickets along the process flow.

In this section we elaborate on the issue types, the statuses and the flows that are attached to these issue type. In every case there is a 'rationale' behind them that explains why we do the things the way we do them.

## Jira Issue Types

**An epic** is a collection of work to be done on a product to implement a new or improved element of the product. It can best be characterized as a feature of a product that will deliver value for the users of the product and/or the product manager and owner. For the business owners and stakeholders the epic is the key element to monitor the evolution of the product. It has a clear link to a solution, being a 'project' that will introduce a change to one or more products to deliver a particular value \(stream\).

**A user story** is a short, well described element - part of an epic - in which a certain change in the functionality\(ies\) of a product is being recorded. It is very tangible, i.e, the scrum team understand what is asked and how to build it, the tester understands what was asked and can test the delivered functionality accordingly. Later in this section - when describing the flow behind testing and releasing user stories we will further elaborate on this.

A user story can consist of one or many **subtasks** breaking down the work to be done to implement the user story. This is especially useful when various team members need to work together on the implementation. Making arrangements on who will do what and the order in which the things need to be done is a smart thing to do.

As long as we need to 'think' about the content of a user story we are refining the user story. For this we use a **refinement story** issue type in Jira. Refinement is done by whoever is needed to get the requirements, the acceptance criteria, the design and the way we will implement the user story sorted out. Various people can work together during one or more iterations to get the refinement done. The end result is one or more user stories with clear content.

**Technical stories** are reserved for the technical members of the agile teams and are used for purely technical work to be carried out, e.g. optimize hardware, organize back-ups, etc. They are carried out by technical team members and will not be tested and validated by others. 

**Innovation stories** are used to describe innovations where the team will work on during the IPI, the last sprint of a Groeispurt \(program increment\).

**Bugs** are defects that are being logged out of functional testing of the user stories that were delivered by the scrum \(dev\) team. They have a link to the user story they relate to and are usually logged by testers who test the delivered functionalities in coordination with the scrum \(dev\) team and the product owner. The follow a certain flow in Jira. Later in this section - when describing the flow behind testing and releasing user stories we will further elaborate on this.

**Meeting stories** are sometimes used by teams to capture work for long meetings \(e.g. the central planning day\) to make sure capacity is attributed to them. Some product teams use them, other just take into account a 'buffer' of time for meetings while planning tickets in a new sprint.
