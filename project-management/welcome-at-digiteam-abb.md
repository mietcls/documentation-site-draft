## Hybrid work/ collaboration at Digiteam ABB

At Digiteam ABB - even more than before the pandemic - we work very efficiently and effectively (together) remotely. All Agile sprint and spurt rituals associated with our result-oriented SAFE operation remain digital. Inside and outside meetings, there is plenty of room and trust for social interaction. Working time/ Availability has never been an issue: everyone is there when needed or has made agreements to cover any absence.

Although there is little or no work content that requires this, several team members indicate that it is desirable to see each other in a physical way at regular time intervals, e.g. to have lunch or drink coffee together, to talk to each other in a different environment than home, .. However, it turns out that it is not easy to meet each other if everyone is present at the workplace at different times. Moreover since the start of the pandemic our teams have grown significantly, which means that a complete return to the situation before the pandemic is not entirely feasible.

To ensure that we meet each other more easily, we plotted out the following agreements:

* We try - as much as possible -  to be in Brussels on Mondays and in Ghent on Fridays.
* At least on the Monday of the biweekly sprint reporting, we block space in our agendas to eat or drink coffee together.

At first we want to test this with the product managers and product owners, analysts, the members of the solution team and other colleagues who work across the products. When developers, designers and testers need physical presence and interaction, they are of course also very welcome to join in on those days. Of course, this does not prohibits any additional or other arrangements within each product team.

We realize that people can be less productive on days when they are on the road. We are aware of the impact this has on the results and stress level of individual colleagues. Open feedback is an important value within our team and that applies here too: talking about it helps to keep mutual expectations sharp.
