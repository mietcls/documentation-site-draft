## Appuniversum Base: HTML & CSS

{% embed url="https://appuniversum.github.io/appuniversum/" %}

The _Appuniversum base_ consists only of HTML and CSS. Anyone can use these basic elements (HTML elements that do not require JavaScript) in their applications, regardless of the technological choices they have made in terms of JavaScript libraries. Read more about the guidelines on the [documentation site](https://appuniversum.github.io/appuniversum/).

## Ember-Appuniversum: Ember.js & HTML & CSS

{% embed url="https://appuniversum.github.io/ember-appuniversum/" %}

Our applications use Ember.js as their Javascript framework. Only Kalliope uses a different platform, offered as a software package from a vendor.

For this reason, we build our web components in Ember. These cannot be easily exchanged with other application builders within VO, but they may always reuse our code. Webuniversum uses Vue.js.
