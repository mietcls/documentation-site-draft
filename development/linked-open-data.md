### Why Local Decisions as Linked Open Data?

Local decisions contain valuable authentic data for everyone.

* As a citizen, I want to know when my street is inaccessible because of works.
* As an entrepreneur, I want to know what obligations I have to fulfil.
* As an association, I want to know if I can get subsidies, and how much.
* As a member of civil society, I want to know how local authorities shape their cultural policy.

By publishing the data in local decisions as linked open data, organisations can reuse that data more easily. Linked data is standardised, making it easy for machines to find and process it. Anyone can work with the information in the local acts thanks to LBLOD.

A concrete example: agencies and departments of the Flemish government can themselves extract the information they need from the published decrees. Local authorities do not have to send or deliver this information every time.
