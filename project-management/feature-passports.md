# Feature Passports



{% hint style="info" %}
Feature passports exist to support a documentation culture; which is encouraged when building open source applications â€“ as we want to enable people to contribute whenever they want.

## Function of Feature Passports

Feature passports exists to communicate with team members about the common understanding and status of features that are \(about to be\) implemented or improved upon.

Use feature passports to:

1. Write down knowledge that lives in people's heads
2. Comment & discuss
3. Find a source of truth for execution \(but keep rule 2 in mind, it is not set in stone\)
4. Onboard & update team members

Making sure everyone understands what we are going to build, and what the status is.
