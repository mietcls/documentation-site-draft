# Agile product development at ABB

The way we develop our products and collaborate together is based on the [Scaled Agile Framework \(SAFe\)](https://www.scaledagileframework.com), be it with some adaptations to better match our ABB Digiteam way of doing things and the number of people in our team.

## Agile product development! Why?

Big challenges are broken down in smaller, manageable parts. In doing so a constant flow emerges and as a team we can see our solutions grow.

* Transparent overview on the work done and to be done
* Divide our work in manageable parts
* Plan enough and plan in a flexible way
* Getting the responsabilities in the right place

## We try to keep a constant pace on three levels:

* Our Rolling Wave based[ **roadmap**]() looks ahead for at least one year.
* The ****[**Groeispurts**]() of ten weeks systematically end with a [**Centrale Planningsdag**]().
* Every Groeispurt consists out of four [**sprints**]() ****and one[ **IPI**]().

The release of product features that have been developed and tested is not necessarily linked to the pace we follow at our three levels.

### Roadmap

We use a comprehensive roadmap. We find it important to define for who a specific functionality will provide value. This roadmap can be found in our [online-tool](https://digiteamabb.airfocus.com/share/e10b08ccff8cb4548c5c5c7525caf368) which is linked to JIRA. JIRA is used by the productteams to plan and follow-up sprints and spurts.

Creating and adjusting the roadmap is a continuous process: this is adjusted every spurt in function of the results and experiences of the past spurt and any additional goals or changed priorities.
