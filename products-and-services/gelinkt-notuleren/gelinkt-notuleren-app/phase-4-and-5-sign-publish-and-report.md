# Phase 4 & 5: Sign, Publish & Report

## Phase 4: Sign

Both the agenda, decision list, minutes and excerpts should be signed.

One can sign digitally via Linked Notification. Signing is done based on the identity of the authorised persons. These individuals log in via ACM-IDM, and can then be signed simply by clicking "sign".

## Fase 5: Publishing & Reporting of the Decision List, Minutes and Specific Decisions

Certain documents are required to be published and/or reported: [https://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/werking-bestuur/bekendmakingsplicht](https://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/werking-bestuur/bekendmakingsplicht) \[Dutch\]

[https://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/lokale-besluiten-als-gelinkte-open-data/gelinkte-publicatieplicht](https://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/lokale-besluiten-als-gelinkte-open-data/gelinkte-publicatieplicht) \[Dutch\]

There are different deadlines for each document here:

* **Agenda**: publication 8 days before the session
* **Decision list**: publication and notification 10 days after the meeting
* **Minutes**: publication and notification after approval at the next meeting.
* Depending on the type of decision, other agenda items are published and reported separately. These have different deadlines.

One can publish and report without signing. It is important that the board does have a signed version available to be legally compliant.

## How does it work in Gelinkt Notuleren?

Our manual gives a clear view on how GN works \[Dutch\].

### Publish

The draft agenda, supplemental agenda, and urgent agenda are published linked through the software vendor \(such as Gelinkt Notuleren, for example\) and are posted on the website. When published through GN, it lands on the [publishing environment](http://publicatie.gelinkt-notuleren.vlaanderen.be/). Local governments can link to this page.

### Report

Reporting can be done automatically through a vendor, semi-automatically through gelinkt Notuleren \(with a review in Box office for Local Governments/Loket voor Lokale Besturen\) or manually through Box office for Local Governments \(Loket voor Lokale Besturen\).

Subtitles available in player.

### Approving notes

At the next session, the minutes from the previous session are approved \(or the session after, if there are still adjustments to be made\).

### Excerpts

There are certain documents, such as environmental permits, that can be delivered to certain parties even before the minutes are approved. It is possible to sign, publish and report these separately.

This can also be explicitly printed out in Gelinkt Notuleren.
