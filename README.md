### **Assignment**

ABB is an agile organisation that inspires policy and provides answers for the administrative and social challenges of today and tomorrow

### Vision

We connect and strengthen citizens and local government through:

The promotion of equal opportunities and living together of citizens in diversity. The supply of a policy framework and instruments which boast the relationship between citizens and local government. The strengthening of the governance capacity of local government, so that tasks can be implemented on the level nearest to the citizen

### Waarden

* **Collaboration & Agility**\
  We find solutions together, believe in the power of collaboration and are open to new challenges.
* **Trust & Integrity**\
  We give and earn trust and promote integrity.
* **Openness**\
  We provide clear information, share our knowledge and operate with transparency.&#x20;
* **Decisiveness**\
  We say what we do and do what we say.

## **A Semantic Ecosystem**

### **The Value We Deliver For Our Society**

More than 300 Local Governments in Flanders write decisions that contain valuable information – every day. We want to make sure that by using linked open data, they can publish their information and (legal) documents directly, and make direct data exchange possible. We make sure we have reusable resources, so that information can flow to other governments & services,  citizens, organisations and companies.

ABB provides support for quality & efficiency, to strengthen those local governments.

### The Solutions We Build

We build services and products to create that value. Linked data is made possible in 3 ways:

1. We co-created a [Linked Open Data](lblod-lokale-besturen-and-linked-open-data.md) Standard, together with the local governments: a standard way of sharing data between the involved parties.
2. We validate vendors that provide software that supports note taking for local governments; and make sure they exchange and publish their data in a correct manner. [More info \[Dutch\]](https://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/lokale-besluiten-als-gelinkte-open-data/validaties-notuleringspakketten).
3. We created ["Linked Minutes" (Gelink Notuleren)](products-and-services/gelinkt-notuleren/): basic, free decision-making software for local governments without a software vendor – to support linked data.
4. We are building an innovative open source [linked data text editor](https://say-editor.com) that allows end users to create machine-readable information 'without effort'. We reuse this editor in our own applications and make sure that external parties can also easily reuse it.

This information is captured in the ["Box Office for Local Governments" (Loket voor Lokale besturen)](products-and-services/loket-voor-lokale-besturen/) – a platform for data sharing and communication between local governments and the agency for home affairs.

We make this [public data available for other governments & services and private re-users](products-and-services/wikis-and-publieke-databanken-public-databases/).

The Agency of home affairs deliver support via their helpdesk, give trainings and develop solutions to support local governments.
