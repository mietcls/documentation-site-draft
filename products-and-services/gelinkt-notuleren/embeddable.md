# Embeddable

The Embeddable is a building block of Gelinkt Notuleren. It is a smart, open-source text editor that enriches specific information from minutes with data, in a structured way, so that we can extract and reuse that information afterwards.

Third-party note-taking software that help local boards create minutes, can also reuse this embeddable in their software package to extract the data.

We provide this word processor as an _embeddable_ \(easily plugged in\) for that boards or their software vendors can use in their notetaking packages. We also open up this embeddable under the name of **Say Editor** for anyone who wants to enrich their word processing with knowledge.
