## What Designers Do

Designers at ABB work on different fields and overlap with people in other _disciplines_ as well (front-end, analysis, ...). It's up to you which fields you would like to contribute to. Some examples of what we do:

* Conceptualisation
* Analysis
* User interviews
* Wireframing & sketches
* High fidelity mockups
* HTML & CSS
* User testing
* Branding
* Presentations
