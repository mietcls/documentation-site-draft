## Component libraries

### Webuniversum

{% embed url="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/webuniversum/v3/" %}

The Flemish Government has built a web component library. We are not currently using it:

* In its current form, the 3.0 version, this library is available when we use their Web platform. Within our application architecture, we do not use that Web platform, and therefore cannot use the Web component library.
* The 3.0 version is not open source. We create open source applications, and thus need open source solution. Our applications are based on their Web components, an older version, when they were still published open source.

### Appuniversum, Webuniversum's Little Sister

To build our applications with, we created an open source component library.

The library is based on the old web components of the Flemish Government, [version 2.0](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/webuniversum/webcomponenten-versie-2). This is where we built our applications with in the beginning, when they were still published open source. To make sure we could fix bugs, extend the library for specific application components and publish our applications open source, we created Appuniversum. Anyone who wishes to use this library, more specifically in the context of projects for the Flemish Government, may do so.

 This component library currently consists of two parts: [Appuniversum](css.md#html-and-css) & [Ember-Appuniversum](css.md#ember-js-and-html-and-css).
