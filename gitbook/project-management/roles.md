# Roles

## Product team

A Product team consists of a Product Owner, Scrum Master and a delivery team. Using Scrum the product team delivers functionality and solutions within the existing cadence.

Product teams have all necessary skills to develiver value each and every sprint.  They are **multidisciplinary**. Next to that scrum teams are **self-steering** and mutually determine who takes up which parts.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner translates the product vision (always focused on the customer experience) into functional actions and with **the purpose**, together with business experts and IT-colleagues, to arrive at processes, services and applications that meet customer needs and deliver value within the value streams of ABB. This is done according to the agreed standards in terms of time, quality and costs.

* partners with the [Product Manager](broken-reference);
* translates the vision on the product into functional actions in order to saveguard the objectives;
* stimulates the team to define 'quality' stories and to prioritize the backlog;
* maximizes value for the stakeholders together with the product team;
* ensures that what is delivered matches the needs of the stakeholders;
* retrieves valuable information inside and outside of the organization and builds up stable  internal and external networks for this;
* applies the techniques of agile product management and business analysis according to the established quality requirements and procedures;

### Development team

The development team is multi disciplinary and therefore consists not only of developers but  also designers, analysts, architects and testers. These are often not exclusively allocated to one product at Digiteam ABB.

## Product Manager

The Product Manager defines on a strategic level the vision for the customers on a product with the aim of translating this vision into a roadmap for the product and solutions. This is done in line with the agreed standards in terms of time, quality and costs.

* works closely with a wide range of people to identify stakeholder needs and understand the solution context;
* encourages and organizes collaboration within the team so that the product creates value for stakeholders;
* develops a vision for the product, draws up a roadmap and translates it into solutions that the team continues to work on;
* demonstrates how a solution positively impacts a value stream and thus can provide value for internal and external customers;
* opens up new areas for which the product can deliver value;
* identifies and contacts potential users and integration partners;
* works in tandem with the Product Owner who translates the vision into concrete epics and stories for the product team;
* (optional) a PM can also be responsible for a solution that involves more than his/her product.

### Business analyst

The product manager cannot work out and determine the solutions on the product roadmap on his or her own. He or she can call on a business analyst for this, who will work out the best business solution together with others (designers, architects, product owner) using a methodology and a set of tools.

The business analyst therefore helps to translate the high-level solution into epics in which the best possible implementation of the solution on the product roadmap is plotted out so that it can be implemented and - after delivery - also realizes the predetermined value.

Once the 'business problem statement' has been well understood and the most suitable solution has been documented, the business analyst offers further support during the writing and updating of the epics so that they can be (technically) implemented and subsequently meet the expected objectives.

## Community of practice

In order to stimulate knowledge sharing about and consistency in, for example, the techniques used, Communities of Practices are periodically organized by the (Solution)Train Engineer. A COP takes place around a certain role in the operation or specific competences. During these meetings, examples are shared, new techniques are taught or even new practices are developed.

## Supporting roles on Solution Level

### Solution Manager

Monitors the effective value realization from solutions by

* clarifing the potential of solutions based on input from other stakeholders. For example by using value tokens, solution tokens & impact maps;
* stimulating and supporting contact between project team and (end) users;
* launching solutions inside and outside ABB.

### Treinbegeleider/ Train Engineer

The train Engineer ensures that the necessary process and technical coordination (between products) takes place and even encourages this. Ideally, this starts from the roadmap and the value streams.

In addition, the train conductor supervises the learning and continuous improvement of the SAFe operation. This both within the Project Team and more broadly throughout ABB.

* works closely with the Product Owners and Product Managers to encourage and guide alignment;
*   ensures that the value streams and roadmap are up-to-date and known;

    organizes and facilitates important consultation moments (Central Planning Day, Communities of Practices, Solution Stand-ups);
* organizes periodic retrospectives and ensures that improvements based on the insights come about;
* provides support and 'first aid' on Agile working from product to solution level.

### Other roles on Solution level

* The **Digital Solutions manager** incorporates solutions in the Solution Roadmap. Coordinates information, resources and capacity so that solutions can be developed.
* The **ICT architect** determines the architectural roadmap and technology strategy. Within this framework, it monitors the best fit of solution with technology.
* The **ICT director** brings in possible value questions from the organization and monitors the strategic alignment.
